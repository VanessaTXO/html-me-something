                <h2>Tigers</h2>
                <p>I have a fascination with the biggest, baddest cat around - the tiger. They're fierce and absoulutely gorgeous. Tigers are a cat that loves to swim and just does what it wants. Their colors and markings are bold and beautiful like they are. All in all they are magnificent animals.</p>

                <h2>Poodle</h2>
                <p>I grew up with big dogs - rottweilers to be specific. Rottweilers are nice, but then I met Wilson. Once you go poodle you never go back. Poodles are fun, graceful beautiful dogs. They're not just a pretty face but they are intelligent as well. They are in the top 5 smartest dog breeds. They walk with is incredible confidence and are sweet and loyal. As an added bonus, they do not shed. They love people and make people love them back.</p>

                <h2>Traveling</h2>
                <p>I've never been into shopping. I'd rather go to fun places around our surprisingly small world. Here's me in Venice. Ever since age 11, I told myself I had to see Venice before it finished sinking. Goal accomplished.</p>
